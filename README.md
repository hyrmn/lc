# Line Counter

This is a small command-line utility to count lines in text. That's it. That's all it does. Technically, it doesn't even care if it's text. 

There are some counting assumptions that I made. Basically, if it shows as a line in my text editor, I want to count it as a line. This means a zero-length file has a line count of 1. A blank line at the end of a file will count as 1.
